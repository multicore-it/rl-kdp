1. Error when running the example program:
TypeError: Descriptors cannot be created directly.
If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
  (1) Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
  (2) Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).

1. Solution:
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install protobuf==3.8

2. Solution for dictionary handling:
state = env.reset()
state = state[0]  # Add this line to fix the issue

3. Solution for adding return values:
state_next, reward, done, none, none2 = self.env.step(action)
